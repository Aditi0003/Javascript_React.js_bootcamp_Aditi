                This was really an amazing bootcamp by Shaurya Sinha.
                I had a very good experience of learning and I got a 
                basic idea about javascript and React.js, HTML. I would want
                more such bootcamps in future as they are really useful in learning something 
                from scratch.
              </p>
      </div>)

export default Note;
